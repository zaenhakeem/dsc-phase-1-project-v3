    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re looking into whether it’s a good idea for the company to enter the aviation industry by diving deep into historical aviation accident data, spanning from 1962 to 2023. The goal is to pull out insights that help decision-makers figure out which aircraft are the safest, what factors contribute to accidents, and how we can avoid these risks. This way, we can reduce our exposure to potential hazards and make smart investment decisions while ensuring we can compete effectively in the aviation market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aviation industry has a lot of moving parts — from aircraft models to weather conditions, pilot experience, and even regional regulations. By digging into the data, we’re hoping to find answers to key questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aircraft Safety**: What aircraft models have the least accidents and fatalities? This will help the company make informed decisions about what kind of planes we should invest in for our operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Geography**: Are certain regions safer than others when it comes to aviation? It would help to know where we’re most likely to face risks, whether that’s due to weather, infrastructure, or air traffic control standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Purpose of Flight**: Whether a flight is personal, for business, or for training makes a big difference when it comes to safety. This analysis will help us understand which type of flights we should prioritize.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Weather Conditions**: Weather is a major factor in accidents. Understanding how different conditions impact safety will allow us to put measures in place and plan accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Which aircraft models are safest?** This is vital for us to make the right decisions when purchasing planes for the business.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Which regions have the best safety records?** This will help guide where we set up operations and what kind of risks we might need to mitigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How does the flight’s purpose affect safety?** Whether a flight is for business, personal, or training makes a big difference in terms of risk. Knowing this will allow us to focus on the safest and most efficient operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What role does weather play in accidents?** Understanding this will help us adjust operations and safety protocols based on weather risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this analysis, we expect to have a clearer picture of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aircraft Purchases**: Recommendations on which aircraft types we should invest in, based on safety records.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Operational Strategy**: What type of flights will be safest and most profitable for us to focus on.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Geographical Focus**: Identifying regions that have the lowest risks for our operations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Risk Management**: Suggestions for safety measures (like pilot training or tech investments) that will help us reduce accident risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights will guide how we enter the aviation market, ensuring our decisions are based on safety and long-term success.\n"
